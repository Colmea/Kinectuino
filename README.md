What is Kinectuino ?
====================

Kinectuino aims to give a user-friendly and fully configurable UI to send data from your Kinect to your Arduino.
Kinectuino offers a simple way to manage Kinect gestures and speech recognition.

How does it work ?
==================

Once you've plugged your Kinect, Kinectuino can send data to your USB port and your Arduino.
You can configure which data is send, port, and more...

But what makes Kinectuino a really interesting tool is the fully configurable speech recognition feature.
Thanks to the Kinectuino dictionary, you can manage dozen of voice commands, choose wich data send and even *add your own voice command* !
